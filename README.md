What is the purpose of data wrangling?
Data wrangling is the process of converting data from the initial format to a format that may be better for analysis.



Data Standardization
Data is usually collected from different agencies in different formats. (Data standardization is also a term for a particular type of data normalization where we subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.)

What is standardization?

Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format, allowing the researcher to make the meaningful comparison.



Data Normalization
Why normalization?

Normalization is the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range. Typical normalizations include scaling the variable so the variable average is 0, scaling the variable so the variance is 1, or scaling the variable so the variable values range from 0 to 1.



Binning
Why binning?
Binning is a process of transforming continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical 'bins' for grouped analysis.
